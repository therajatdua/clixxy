## 💻 Getting Started

You will need a Supabase backend to run Clixy locally.

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnarajodhiya/clixy.git
cd clixy
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project with your Supabase credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app!

## 🔐 Notes on Auth Proxy
In environments or specific countries where ISPs intentionally block default Supabase subdomains (`*.supabase.co`), Clixy uses an elegant built-in Next.js Rewrite rule (`next.config.ts`) to securely proxy `yourwebsite.com/api/supabase` directly to your backend, fixing email verification workflows that would normally throw DNS failures.
